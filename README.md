# 🏦 Bank Database (OLTP)  

## 📌 Project Description  

This project is a **Database Design and SQL Implementation showcase**.  

- I started by designing the schema using **dbdiagram.io**, where I modeled the tables, relationships, and constraints.  
- Based on this design, I generated the **MySQL script** for table creation, constraints, and relationships.  
- Later, I also wrote the **MS SQL Server script** for compatibility and learning purposes.  

The project demonstrates core database design concepts such as:  
- ✅ Primary Keys  
- ✅ Foreign Keys  
- ✅ Unique Constraints  
- ✅ Relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)  

This project is mainly for **portfolio and learning purposes** to showcase my understanding of **database design and SQL development**.
